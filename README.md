# Webbers Website Source code

The main website for Webbers Organization. It was developed for the team members to know their weekly tasks and submit them before being published on the internet.
The website consists of 4 part as follows:

* The social media part, in which the social media members can post campaigns and marketing strategies and social media posts; Other social media and HR members and head can comment and give them suggestions before being committed by the social media head.
* The HR part, in which the HR members can get their tasks, either reports or analyses and post them or DM them to the HR head.
* The PR part, the same as HR part but differs in the task's type.
* The Units part; the units system distributes the team members to 7 units such that each unit corresponds to a week day. Each unit members get their tasks a week before the release date. Tasks are automatically sent to the members' emails right after they are published on the website.
